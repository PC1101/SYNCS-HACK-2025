*An all-in-one tool for rainwater recycling optimisation*

## 🚩 Problem Overview  

Even though Sydney receives regular rainfall, only about a third of suitable homes actually use rainwater tanks—and those that do save just ~21% of household water demand (Sydney Water, 2013). Many tanks sit full and unused during major rains (Kingspan, 2020), while others are installed in default sizes that cost more than they save (Rahman, 2012).  

In short, Sydney is sitting on a hidden water reserve, but it’s mostly untapped. The reason is that decision makers lack the tools needed to allocate water resources proactively, and NSW needs a system that can better manage rainfall recycling systems.

## 💡 Our Solution  

We built a **risk scoring system** that:  
- Provides real-time rainfall data of suburbs in NSW.  
- Predicts drought risk probability using historical rainfall data and population density.  
- Converts drought risk into **1–5 classes** for easy visualisation.

## 📊 Data Sources  

- **Rainfall data:** [Bureau of Meteorology, NSW (BOM)](http://www.bom.gov.au/) station records.  
- **Population data:** Australian [Bureau of Statistics](https://www.abs.gov.au/statistics/people/).

## 🔬 Methodology  

1. **Data Preprocessing**  
   - Flatten raw JSONs (nested by year → month → day).  
   - Compute rolling rainfall sums (7-day, 30-day).  

2. **Drought Labels**  
   - Define drought = lowest 20% of historical 30-day rainfall per station.  

3. **Feature Engineering**  
   - Rainfall anomaly (monthly z-score).  
   - Population exposure (2025).  

4. **Model**  
   - Random Forest Classifier (binary drought vs. not drought).  
   - Probability output → discretized into 5 risk classes.  

5. **Impact Score**  
   - Population-adjusted Risk Scores (**Risk × Normalized Population**).
