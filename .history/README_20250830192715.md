Project Name: 
UrbanOasis - an all-in-one tool for rain water recycling optimisation 

Problem Overview: 
Even though Sydney receives regular rainfall, only about a third of suitable homes actually use rainwater tanks—and those that do save just ~21% of household water demand (Sydney Water, 2013; Kingspan, 2020). Many tanks sit full and unused during major rains (Kingspan, 2020), while others are installed in default sizes that cost more than they save (Tam 2010; Rahman2012). 

In short, Sydney is sitting on a hidden water reserve—but it’s mostly untapped. Reason being decision makers lack the tools needed to allocate water resources proactively, and NSW is in need for a system that can better manange rainfall recycling system. 

Our Solution: 

Thus we built a risk scoring system that:
- Provides real-time rainfall data of suburbs in NSW
- Predicts drought risk probability using historical rainfall data and population density. 
- Convert drought risk into 1-5  classes for easy visualisation.

Data Sources:
- Rainfall data: [Beureau of Meteorology, NSW (BOM)](http://www.bom.gov.au/) station records 
- Population data: Australian [Beureau of Statistics](https://www.abs.gov.au/statistics/people/)
  

Methodology

1. Data Preprocessing:

   - Flatten raw JSONs (nested by year → month → day).

   - Compute rolling rainfall sums (7-day, 30-day).

2. Drought Labels:

   - Define drought = lowest 20% of historical 30-day rainfall per station.

3. Feature Engineering:

Rainfall anomaly (monthly z-score).

Population exposure (2025).

Model:

Random Forest Classifier (binary drought vs. not drought).

Probability output → discretized into 5 risk classes.

Impact Score:

Risk × Normalized Population.
