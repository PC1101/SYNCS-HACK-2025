Project Name: 
UrbanOasis - an all-in-one tool for rain water recycling optimisation 

Problem Overview: 
Even though Sydney receives regular rainfall, only about a third of suitable homes actually use rainwater tanks—and those that do save just ~21% of household water demand (Sydney Water, 2013; Kingspan, 2020). Many tanks sit full and unused during major rains (Kingspan, 2020), while others are installed in default sizes that cost more than they save (Tam 2010; Rahman2012). 

In short, Sydney is sitting on a hidden water reserve—but it’s mostly untapped. Reason being decision makers lack the tools needed to allocate water resources proactively, and NSW is in need for a system that can better manange rainfall recycling system.
