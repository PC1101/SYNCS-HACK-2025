Project Name: 
UrbanOasis - an all-in-one tool for rain water recycling optimisation 

Overview: 
Even though rain falls six times every year, only about a third of suitable Sydney homes use rainwater tanks—and those that do save just ~21% of water. Many of these tanks sit full unused during major rains; others are default sizes that cost more than they save. In short, we're sitting on a hidden water reserve—but it’s mostly untapped.UrbanOasis is a tool that allows you to monitor real time rain fall data of suburbs in the city of New South Wales. Forecast
