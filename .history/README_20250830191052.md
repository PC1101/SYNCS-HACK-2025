🌍 Overview

Brief intro:

What the project does (predict drought risk across suburbs using rainfall + population).

Why it matters (climate change, resource allocation, protecting communities).

🚩 Problem Statement

Cities face increasing drought risks due to climate change.

Decision-makers lack tools to allocate water resources proactively.

Need a system that integrates climate hazard + population exposure.

💡 Our Solution

Built a risk scoring system that:

Predicts drought risk probability using rainfall data.

Converts risk into 1–5 classes for easy visualization.

Weighs risk by population impact for prioritization.

Outputs per-station JSONs ready for dashboard visualisation.

📊 Data Sources

Rainfall data: Bureau of Meteorology (BOM) station records (historical daily rainfall).

Population data: 2025 suburb population estimates (ABS).

🔬 Methodology

Data Preprocessing:

Flatten raw JSONs (nested by year → month → day).

Compute rolling rainfall sums (7-day, 30-day).

Drought Labels:

Define drought = lowest 20% of historical 30-day rainfall per station.

Feature Engineering:

Rainfall anomaly (monthly z-score).

Population exposure (2025).

Model:

Random Forest Classifier (binary drought vs. not drought).

Probability output → discretized into 5 risk classes.

Impact Score:

Risk × Normalized Population.

✨ Features

🌧️ Predict drought risk probability from rainfall data.

📊 Convert probabilities into risk classes (1–5).

👥 Adjust for population to highlight impact hotspots.

🗂️ Outputs combined JSON + per-station JSONs for dashboards.

⚙️ How It Works

Input: raw rainfall JSONs (stationNum, stationName, years → months → days).

Processing: flatten → feature engineering → train Random Forest → predict risk.

Output: JSON files with {station_name, date, population_2025, rainfall_mm, risk_class}.

🌐 Impact

Helps cities prioritize high-risk, high-population suburbs.

Supports smarter water allocation policies.

Raises awareness about climate-resilient infrastructure planning.

🛠️ Installation
# clone repo
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/project-name.git
cd project-name

# install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

▶️ Usage
python riskscoring.py


Place raw rainfall JSONs in weather data/.

Place population.csv (station_name, population) in same folder.

Outputs JSONs in out/.

🚀 Future Work

Integrate temperature, soil moisture, and evaporation into model.

Use forecast rainfall data for predictive risk.

Build an interactive dashboard (Streamlit/Plotly) for real-time monitoring.

Deploy as a web service API.
